Soldering-iron-driver
=====================

Alternate soldering iron driver firmware featuring button debounce and autorepeat. This firmware tested with buttons but not with a rotary encoder-- in which case you should use the original by bogdan at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/arhimed-sid/

You can find precompiled bin files in the dist directory. There is one compiled for a bootloader and another without. Enjoy.
